# Node-Socket.io-Chat-App
This is a basic implementation of real time chat rooms using Node JS and Socket.io.
User can login using name and chat room name. A list of active users in respective room is shown on the left.

I encourage you to fork, clone, and play around it. There's a lot more to extend it. You can use it as a reference or a starter template in your projects.
